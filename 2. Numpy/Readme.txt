NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
#filter
The boolean array x serves as a mask, and it selects elements from the original array arr where the corresponding value in x is True.
In this case, the selected elements are the ones at indices where x is True: 41, 40, and 43.
So, newarr contains the elements [41, 40, 43], which are the values in arr where the corresponding x value is True.
